''' Girvan Newmann Algorithm : 
	  Basic overview : 
			 Edge Betweenness => Fraction of all pair shortest path that pass through a Given Edge
			 Bridge => Considered to be an edge which has a high edge Betweenness
			 B/w distinct communities there should be presence of bridges

	  Steps: 
			1. Compute the edge Betweenness for the graph
			2. Choose the edge with the highest edge betweenness and remove into
			3. Go to step 1 until no edges are left (If modularity is improving then add to the community structure)


	  Measure of checking Community Structure : Modularity
