   Spectral Clustering Algorithm : 
      -> Based on the connectivity between the nodes
      Steps: 
            1. Compute Adjacency Matrix for the given Graph
            2. Compute the Laplacian Matrix for the Graph (Diagonal Degree Matrix - Adjacency Matrix)
            3. Normalize the matrix
            4. Get the Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors corresponding to the Normalized Laplacian Matrix
            5. Choose the number of clusters (say k), then choose k eigen vectors corresponding to eigen values
            6. Apply K-means on them to cluster the nodes with number of clusters as k

      @_parameters : 
         lap => normalized laplacian matrix
         eigen_number => The number of Eigen vectors to be obtained

      @_return :
         A numpy array with cluster labels corresponding to each node
